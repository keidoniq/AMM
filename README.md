# Arduino Projects

TM1637 Display Project, or lab_1 demonstrates how to use a TM1637 4-digit 7-segment display module with an Arduino. 
The display shows various sequences of numbers and characters using custom-defined segments.

Temperature and Humidity Display Project, or lab_2 uses an Arduino, a TM1637 4-digit 7-segment display, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to display temperature in Fahrenheit and humidity in percentage on the 7-segment display.

Keypad and LCD Menu System, or lab_3 uses an Arduino, a 4x4 matrix keypad, a LiquidCrystal I2C display, and EEPROM to create a simple menu-driven system.


## Components
* Arduino board (Arduino Mega)
* Jumper wires
  
`lab_1`

  <summary>lab_1</summary>

*kim1_4*      Counts down from 100 to 0 in steps of 2, displaying each number. Displays the character "MIN" after clearing the display.
Counts up from 0 to 100 in steps of 2, displaying each number.

*kim2_1*      Counts down from 200 to 0 in steps of 20, displaying each number with a decimal point. Clears the display.
Counts up from 0 to 200 in steps of 20, displaying each number with a decimal point.

*kim3_4*      Continuously scrolls the string "TRAIN LEFT" across the display.

*Main Loop*    sets the brightness of the display and calls the defined routines in sequence
